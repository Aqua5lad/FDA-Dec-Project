    "The \"box plot\", or more correctly the \"box-and-whisker plot\", is a histogram-like method of displaying groups of numerical data through their quartiles<sup>[1]</sup>. It was invented in 1970 by John Wilder Tukey<sup>[1a]</sup>, an American mathematician best known for development of the FFT algorithm and the box plot. The Tukey range test, the Tukey lambda distribution, the Tukey test of additivity, and the Teichmüller–Tukey lemma all bear his name. He is also credited with coining the term 'bit' <sup>[2]</sup>.\n",

Maple leaves have approximately the same size, but with some variation. Descriptive statistics are an attempt to use numbers to describe how data are the same and not the same. The box plot is a standardized way of displaying the distribution of data based on the five number summary: minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum. "

    "When tasked to compare group datasets, Histograms are helpful for visualizing the distribution of variables. But if you need to 'drill down' for more information, boxplots are very useful. Perhaps we want a clearer view of the standard deviation across multiples data groups? Perhaps the median is quite different from the mean and thus we have many outliers? What if there is some skew and many of the values are concentrated to one side? That’s where boxplots come in. \n",
    "\n",
    "Box plots display all of this information. The bottom and top of the solid-lined box are always the first and third quartiles (i.e 25% and 75% of the data), and the band inside the box is always the second quartile (the median). The whiskers (i.e the dashed lines with the bars on the end) extend from the box to show the range of the data. (https://towardsdatascience.com/5-quick-and-easy-data-visualizations-in-python-with-code-a2284bae952f)\n",

    "While it does not show a distribution in as much detail as a histogram does, it is useful for indicating whether a distribution is skewed and whether there are potentially unusual observations (outliers) in the data set. Box plots are also very useful when large numbers of observations are involved and when two or more data sets are being compared.<sup>[6]</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "ADVANTAGES:    The box plot organizes large amounts of data, and visualizes outlier values.\n",
    "\n",
    "DISADVANTAGES: Its not relevant for detailed analysis of data as it deals with a summary of the data distribution. <sup>[7]</sup>"
