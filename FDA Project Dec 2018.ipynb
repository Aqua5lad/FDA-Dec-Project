    "The \"box plot\", or more correctly the \"box-and-whisker plot\", is a histogram-like method of displaying groups of numerical data through their quartiles<sup>[1]</sup>. It was invented in the 1970s by John Wilder Tukey, an American mathematician best known for development of the FFT algorithm and the box plot. The Tukey range test, the Tukey lambda distribution, the Tukey test of additivity, and the Teichmüller–Tukey lemma all bear his name. He is also credited with coining the term 'bit' <sup>[2]</sup>."

    "In his 1995 book \"The Same AND Not the Same\"<sup>[3]</sup>, Roald Hoffmann, a theoretical chemist who won the 1981 Nobel Prize in Chemistry<sup>[4]</sup>, said this about data: \n",
    "\"They are different, but not different enough to matter - like the maple leaves off the tree in my yard, when all I want to do is rake them up.\"<sup>[5]</sup> \n",
    "\n",
    "\"The Same AND Not the Same\" is a short, accurate description of almost any set of data...a pile of maple leaves for example. Maple leaves have approximately the same size, but with some variation. Descriptive statistics are an attempt to use numbers to describe how data are the same and not the same. The box plot is a standardized way of displaying the distribution of data based on the five number summary: minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum. In the simplest box plot the central rectangle spans the first quartile to the third quartile (the interquartile range or IQR). A segment inside the rectangle shows the median and \"whiskers\" above and below the box show the locations of the minimum and maximum."
